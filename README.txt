# Datalus Browser source
Datalus was forked from the Datalus repository and is being released in accordince with Mozilla Public License 2.0. We are currently using Mozilla's existing build tools so we left the instructions below as we work to recreate them.

An explanation of the Datalus Source Code Directory Structure and links to
project pages with documentation can be found at:

    https://datalus-source-docs.mozilla.org/contributing/directory_structure.html

For information on how to build Datalus from the source code and create the patch see:

    https://datalus-source-docs.mozilla.org/contributing/contribution_quickref.html

If you have a question about developing Datalus, and can't find the solution
on https://datalus-source-docs.mozilla.org/, you can try asking your question on Matrix at chat.mozilla.org in `Introduction` (https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#introduction:mozilla.org) channel.


Nightly development builds can be downloaded from:

    https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/datalus/nightly/latest-mozilla-central/
            - or -
    https://www.mozilla.org/datalus/channel/desktop/#nightly

Keep in mind that nightly builds, which are used by Datalus developers for
testing, may be buggy.
