# nsBrowserGlue.js

# This component must restrict its registration for the app-startup category
# to the specific list of apps that use it so it doesn't get loaded in xpcshell.
# Thus we restrict it to these apps:
#
#   browser:        {1}
#   mobile/android: {aa3c5121-dab2-40e2-81ca-7ea25febc110}
